    Here we ensure that what has been added to the instance is unique.

    The validator can allow instanced nodes however a warning will be logged

    The `cbId` attribute is what is used to uniquely define a specific node
    in the scene and is used by the look development system to store and assign
    the shaders per node. For instances this means that they cannot have unique
    shaders assigned, thus a warning is logged if instances are detected.
