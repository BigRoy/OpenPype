    This collector takes into account assets that are associated with

    Limitations:
        - Does not take into account nodes connected to those
            within an objectSet. Extractors are assumed to export
            with history preserved, but this limits what they will
            be able to achieve and the amount of data available
            to validators. An additional collector could also
            append this input data into the instance, as we do
            for `pype.rig` with collect_history.
